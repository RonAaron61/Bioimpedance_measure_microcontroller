# Bioimpedance_measure_microcontroller
Measuring bioimpedance using a microcontroller

*Note: this project is not done

A tool for measuring a person's bioimpedance, using a microcontroller as a signal processor and reader of measurement results, and displays it. The device that is made consists of a signal generator that uses a AD9833 module to produce a 50 kHz sine wave signal, then VCCS to convert the input voltage into a current source so that it is safe when it enters the body, then the signal is read using an instrument amplifier as an amplifier so that it is easy to read, and converted to a DC signal for reading. It can read resistance/impedance from 82 Ω - 1 kΩ on ±3.25 V supply, and can also read the bioimpedance from human skin and can detect flexion and relax movement. But curently based on the experiment it still have some limitations such as it can only detect 82 Ω - 1 KΩ of impedance, above that the signal will be cuted, and bellow that the ADC can't read it because it to small. But this can be fixed by using higher supply, because currently it used around ±3.2V.

## Schematic

## Components

### Positive to Negative Voltage Converter

Because all the IC that I use need dual rail supply (positive and negative) we need to change from positive input to positive and negative. First I try using LM2662 Module and get the negative supply, but when I try to connect it to the IC, the result signal is not stable with changing offset. So I try using another method which is using a voltage divider with buffer on the ground.

The function of using a buffer on the ground is to make sure both positive and negative supply is the same voltage even when there is load (IC)


### AD9833

To create the sine wave signal I use the AD9833 dds module, which can produce sine, triangle, and square wave signals with 0-12.5 MHz, but in this project, I only use 50 kHz. The module can be powered with 2.3 V to 5.5 V. This module uses 3-wire SPI interface.

When powered with ± 3.25 V it produces around 0.1 V Vrms of sine wave signal at 50kHz (after a high pass to remove DC)

*Ignore the broken screen

Because the signal is too small I use Non inverting amplifier to increase the signal and get around 0.58 V of Vrms

### VCCS

The function of VCCS is to get current sources that can be controlled using the input voltage, so the current doesn't exceed some limit. The VCCS that I used is a standard Howland current source that consists of 5 resistors and an Op-amp.

With R1, R3, R4, R2b = 1kΩ, and R2a = 82 Ω

Based on it's equations:

-> So using the equation the current should be around 0.58 mA.

$$ {Iout \over 0.58 V} = {1 \over 1000} {1000 \over 1000} $$

but after testing it using a 215 Ω resistor I get around 0.11 V vrms, and using basic Ohm's law $I = V/R$ , I = 0.511 mA, and using a 955 Ω resistor I get around 0.52 V vrms, so the current is around 0.544 mA.
So after testing it, it should be safe for humaan


### Instrument amplifier

The instrument amplifier function as an amplifier from two different signal inputs. For the instrument amplifier (IA), I use AD620 IC. One IA is connected to a reference resistor from VCCS, and the other one is placed at the observed object with the same gain value. The gain equation is:

$$ G = {49.4 kΩ \over R<sub>G</sub>} + 1 $$

![image](https://github.com/RonAaron61/Bioimpedance_measure_microcontroller/assets/105662575/cf48099c-1c1c-4573-bc30-73e7e69c18d0)

On the second IA, there's also a High Pass Filter because the signal from the human body will also contain a noise such as Power Line Noise, so we will remove it using a High Pass Filter, I use first-order HPF with a 740 Hz cut-off frequency, with 1 uF capacitor and 220 Ω (215 tested on the multimeter). I first used 1 kΩ (Fc = 159 Hz) but the noise was still present so I tried higher Fc.

### AC to DC converter

Because the output of the signal is still an AC signal, we need to convert it to a DC signal, so the microcontroller can read it. I used a peak detector as the AC-to-DC converter. consisting of an op-amp, diode, capacitor, and resistor. 

![image](https://github.com/RonAaron61/Bioimpedance_measure_microcontroller/assets/105662575/4128837d-0dfe-4be0-a1e1-d2c8b6e17acb)

At first, I didn't use a resistor and when I checked using a multimeter I got a satisfied result, but when it was connected to the microcontroller ADC it suddenly went higher than it should have. So because a multimeter usually has around 1 MΩ impedance, I tried connecting a 1 MΩ resistor to it and got a kinda satisfied result. 

### ADC

For the ADC I don't use the Arduino ADC but I use a module, I use the ADS1115 16bit ADC module

## Results

As mentioned above there's still a problem that I haven't figured out yet. But here are the current results:

For now, I use the 2-electrode method for simplicity, but it can also used 4 electrode method

### Using Resistor

*Using 215ohm Reference resistor

-> 1k Ω (real: 955 Ω)

-> 642 Ω

-> 320 Ω

-> 80 Ω

### On human skin

after testing on a resistor and getting a pretty decent result, next, I tried it on human skin. I try on the biceps and try some flexing and relax to see the difference in the impedance

-> relax (180°)

![IMG_20231010_212323](https://github.com/RonAaron61/Bioimpedance_measure_microcontroller/assets/105662575/a11fd528-4cc6-4d29-8dfd-16c5a544e4a0)

Result:

![flexx4](https://github.com/RonAaron61/Bioimpedance_measure_microcontroller/assets/105662575/c50fa640-f446-416d-b48a-06751453d5ec)

-> 90°

![IMG_20231010_212315](https://github.com/RonAaron61/Bioimpedance_measure_microcontroller/assets/105662575/70f69c8e-3e6e-41fd-b0ca-37c25b953ba6)

Result:

![s4](https://github.com/RonAaron61/Bioimpedance_measure_microcontroller/assets/105662575/545faa30-82f9-478b-9652-0b37f34d6743)

-> flexion (around 40°)

![IMG_20231010_212320](https://github.com/RonAaron61/Bioimpedance_measure_microcontroller/assets/105662575/325b4e28-b0d1-4dfa-aa75-2005ca41768d)

Result:

![lip4](https://github.com/RonAaron61/Bioimpedance_measure_microcontroller/assets/105662575/722dc10b-3eee-422c-8786-bf21f573499a)


So as you can see when I relax the impedance is around 708 Ω and when I flex it changes to around 653 Ω. This is maybe because when you flex the electrode becomes closer so the impedance will also decrease

*Note: I only flex my elbow and not harden my biceps, I still use my own biceps to move but am still relaxed

## Implementation

After trying with both the AD9833 and Wien bridge oscillator, I decided to use the AD9833 because it is more stable and easier to control the frequency. As you can see above when I bend or straighten my hand the impedance also changes, so I try to implement this circuit as an estimation of the angle to control the servo motor based on the angle of my hand
